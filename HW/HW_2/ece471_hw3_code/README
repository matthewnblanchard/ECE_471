ECE 471 Fall 2017 -- Homework 3

Name:

Answer to Question #3a:

#1 Move to end of buffer

#2 Change decimal digit to ASCII equivalent

Answer to Question #7:

a. hello_world        : 624 bytes
   hello_world.thumb  : 604 bytes
   hello_world.thumb2 : 604 bytes
   
   The thumb executables are 20 bytes smaller than the regular ARM
   executable. Notably, the THUMB and THUMB2 executables are the same
   size.

b. The C compiled executable is 3 kilobytes. This is roughly 5 times
   the size of the ARM assembled executable.

c. In a space constrained system, standard ARM would be preferable to
   C due to its small size after assembly. In especially constrained
   spaces, THUMB/THUMB2 code would net an even smaller assembled 
   executable.

d. The C code was much faster to write. Functionality that would take
   many lines of assembly code can be accomplished with very few lines
   of C code. In addition, libraries exist for many common processes 
   (such as printf), so you don't have to write those subroutines 
   yourself.

Answer to Question #8a: A quick search on the year 1752 reveals that
the unusual jump in days (the 2nd to the 14th) is in fact intentional.
All official calendars have them removed. These days were dropped in
order to adjust from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar.
In the British Empire (from which the US was born), this changeover 
happened in the year 1752. By the time they made the change, the 
calendars had 11 days of difference which needed to be discarded. Thus,
September 2nd is followed by September 14th.
