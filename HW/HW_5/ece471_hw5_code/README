6.      My "something cool" plays an animation on the display. It cycles
        through positions from left to right on the display, lighting a single
        segment at a time traversing the perimeter of each display position.

7.
 a). The GPU performs the initial booting steps, running bootcode.bin. This is not
        normal for an ARM board
 b). FAT32 filesystems take up a small amount of space (less overhead) and is simple
        and free. This keeps the boot code space small and simple.
 c). Bootloader
 d). The lower addresses are reserved for future expansion, so no device should
        have them. The upper addresses are used in the 10-bit address extension,
        so no device should have those either.

8.
 a). 81 lines
 b). 57 line difference
