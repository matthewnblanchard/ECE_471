ECE471 Fall 2017 -- HW7

Name: Matthew Blanchard

4. Describe your something cool: Prints a running maximum, minimum, and average of the temperature readings in celsius and fahrenheit every 5th reading

5. a. Compared to I2C, SPI has no standard surrounding it, so there a few guarantees. Also, it uses more wires.
   b. Unlike I2C, SPI is full duplex, and can be much faster.
   c. No. Much like I2C, SPI has a pratical maximum distance of a few meters, due to line capacitance.
   d. The GPIO utilities from the operating system have significant overhead, and are thus unsuitable for high frequency applications,
        such as SPI. It is very unlikely you would be able to meet the 10kHz spec this way. 

6. a. /dev/null discards any input sent to it 
   b. /dev/full always returns an "out of space" error (because it's always full)
   c. /dev/zero could be used to create files filled exclusively with zeros.
   d. /dev/random generates random numbers by gathering entropy from various sources within the device (environmental noise, for instance)
