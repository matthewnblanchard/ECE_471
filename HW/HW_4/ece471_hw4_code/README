ECE 471 Fall 2017 -- Homework 4

Name: Matthew Blanchard


What you did for something cool (if applicable):

Modified the read_switch code so that, in addition to printing to the screen, it
also toggles the LED when the switch state changes.

Answers to Question #5:

a. usleep passes control of the CPU to another program, so that cycles
   are not wasted while a program does nothing. It is also more
   (but not completely) accurate in terms of delay length.

b. The operating system (at least in this case) abstracts away a great
   deal of the complexity which would be involved in accessing and 
   configuring the GPIO pins. Instead of locating the correct memory
   locations for the pins and configuring them via bitmasks, you can
   instead simply open and write to a file, which is more human-readable
   and easier to code (at the cost of speed).

c. There are several configuration options for GPIO pins which are not 
   available in the OS. Pull-up vs. pull-down and clock speed are just
   two examples. Additionally, accessing the GPIO pins from the OS
   is considerably slower, due to a significant amount of overhead. 

d. I would argue that whether a web browser is part of an operating system
   depends on how you define "operating system". If you define an operating
   system to include, in addition to the kernel, the entire ensemble of 
   software which is packaged with it, then yes it is part of the OS. If 
   you define an OS as just the kernel and a few essential utilities, then
   the web browser is not (or at least should not) be part of the OS. I 
   support the later option.

Answers to Question #6:

a. Machine type: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2

b. Kernel version: 4.4.38-v7+ #938 SMP

c. Free Disk space: 18GB out of 30G

d. The -h option makes the output human readable, by converting 
   raw byte sizes to powers of 1024, with the SI prefixes K, M, G, etc.
