Answers to homework questions in Part 7:

(a): You could run "man ls". "man" is short for "manual". This will
        produce the manual pages for the ls program

(b): The -a option (short for -all) causes the program to show all
        files in the directory, including those starting with "."

(c): One major reason that Linux is used in embedded design is that it's free.
        companies don't have to pay for operating system licenses for all of 
        the devices they produce which include the embedded system. 

(d): I am using ssh to connect to my pi. It's set up on my home network with 
        a port forward for port 22 for reachability away from home. To get files
        from websites (such as this homework) I use wget, and to transfer files
        between my pi and other devices I own, I use sftp.
