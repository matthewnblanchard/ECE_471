ECE471 HW#6 -- Fall 2017

Name: Matthew Blanchard

5.   The "cool" code generates bytes to write to the display randomly every 1/10 of a second,
     causing a randomly changing display.

6.
 a). There is no implementation to read a full byte from the slave device. Additionally,
     there is no support for clock stretching. 

 b). If the slave device attempts to stretch the clock, this code does not check.
     In this case the master would read data before it actually begins being transmitted
     and would receive erroneous data.

7.
 a). This would be a hard deadline. If the pulsing does not begin within 10ms,
     the brakes will not operate correctly. If a car's brakes do not operate correctly,
     people can die.

 b). This would be a soft deadline. If the tuning lasts longer than 1 second, it is 
     only a minor inconvenience. The results are still useful (the radio station switches).

 c). This is a firm deadline. The longer it takes for a frame to generate, the less useful
     the frame is. If the frame takes too long, it becomes entirely useless as the viewer
     is no longer interested in that frame.

8.
 a). arch_timer
 b). The yes command outputs "y", or some other provided argument, repeatedly. It is useful
     when piped to some script/utility which prompts the user for confirmation a lot, if the 
     is certain they want to answer "yes" for all ofthese prompts.
